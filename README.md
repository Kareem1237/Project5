# Dashboarding with Python and streamlit

With data from the bundesliga between the 2017 and 2022 season, we generate graphs to take a peak at different characterisitcs; including a team's ranking change after each matchday, which official a team performance worse with him as the referee, etc..

Using streamlit, we create an interactive dashboard that allows the user to choose the team/s and season to explore different insights. The dashboard has been launched and can be accessed here:

In the accompanyinh repository, you can access the python code and data set.

Enjoy!
